# function-args-by-ref

Warns when you should be passing by const-ref.
Types with sizeof > 16 bytes [1] or types which are not trivially-copyable [2] or not trivially-destructible [3] should be passed by ref. A rule of thumb is that if passing by value would trigger copy-ctor and/or dtor then pass by ref instead.

This check will ignore shared pointers, you're on your own. Most of the times passing shared pointers by const-ref is the best thing to do, but occasionally that will lead to crashes if you're in a method that calls something else that makes the shared pointer ref count go down to zero.


#### Fixits
This check supports adding missing `&` or `const-&` with:

    export CLAZY_FIXIT="fix-function-args-by-ref"
