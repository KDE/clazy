# qt6-qhash-signature

> Note: This check is deprecated with Clazy 1.16 and will be removed in later versions!

Warns and corrects the signature for `qHash`.

`uint qHash(MyType x, uint seed)` is replaced with `size_t qHash(MyType x, size_t seed)`

Also corrects the signature for `qHashBits`, `qHashRange` and `qHashRangeCommutative`.

This fix-it is intended to aid the user porting from Qt5 to Qt6.
Run this check with Qt5. The produced fixed code will compile on Qt6.
