Version 1.16
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: not yet

Bugfixes:
 * Fix non-pod-static check emitting warning for each entry of a container
 * Fix use-arrow-operator-instead-of-data emitting false positive when value is casted
 * Do not whitelist QVariant for detaching-temporary. QVariant::toString will provide a QString that is not detached
 * detaching-temporary properly checks conditions when more than two method calls are chained
 * Fixits for detaching-temporary/detaching-member are more reliable with fixit ranges for operator calls
 * When using QT_NAMESPACE, clazy properly handles Qt classes being in this specific namespace
 * Fix wrong replacement method for QMap::operator[]
 * Make project compile with LLVM22. qhash-namespace, fully-qualified-moc-types, old-style-connect tests are fixed
 * Adjust readlock-detaching check to work properly with Qt 6.11 changes
 * Move qstring-ref to manuallevel since it is not compatible with Qt6

Notes:
 * C++20 is now required for compilation
 * qt6-\* porting checks are removed

Version 1.16
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2025-09-03

Bugfixes:
 * unused-result-check: Fix crash when method decleration can not be resolved
 * use-chrono-in-qtimer: Fix crash when using precompiled headers
 * qt6-qhash-signature: Adapt check to use more proper logic for casts and fix crash in edgecases
 * Ensure that clang21 works properly with clazy and produces same line/letter number as before (mismatches with operator calls)
 * non-pod-global-static: Fix false positive with Q_IMPORT_PLUGIN in Qt-6.10

Features:
 * Clazy can finally be integrated into clang-tidy - one command to rule
	 them all! All checks can be enabled using "clazy-<checkname>". For example:
  `clazy-qstring-arg,clazy-qfileinfo-exists`, enabling all checks using
  `clazy-*` will also enable manual checks. It is recommended to be more granular.
  The plugin can be loaded using `-load=ClazyClangTidy.so`, for this, the plugin
  must be in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Otherwise, an absolute path may be specified.
 * isempty-vs-count now provides fixits for all scenarios. Also, cases where
  the length is compared using "== 0", "< 1", "> 0" are now reported and have fixits.
 * qt6-\* Porting checks are considered deprecated now and will be removed in the next release of clazy
 * detaching-temporary and detaching-member checks provide fixits for methods that have const coutnerparts
 * NOLINT/NOLINTNEXTLINE/NOLINTBEGIN/NOLINTEND all work in clazy now as
  expected. Individual clazy checks can be disabled when using a "clazy-"
  prefix. For example "NOLINTNEXTLINE(clazy-qfileinfo-exists, clazy-qstring-arg)"

Version 1.14
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2025-04-27

Notes:
 * Clazy warnings for the following line can be disabled, for example: clazy:exclude-next-line=check1,check2
 * Support for compilation against Clang 20
 * increase verbosity of some warning messages
  - checks `function-args-by-value` and `function-args-by-ref`: add function name and parameter name to warning message

Features:
 * New checks:
  - qbytearray-conversion-to-c-style

 * Fixed clazy slowdown introduced in 1.8. I can be up to 4x faster now.
 * range-loop was split in range-loop-detach and range-loop-reference
 * Fixed -Wclazy-connect-non-signal false positives

Version 1.8
~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2020-11-22

  - overloaded signal
  - invalid JNI signatures
  - qstring-comparison-to-implicit-char
  - qt6-qlatin1string-to-u
  - heap-allocated-small-trivial-type: less false-positives

Bugfixes:

Notes:
 * Building clazy itself is 30% faster

Version 1.6
~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2019-10-12

Features:
 * New Checks:
  - heap-allocated-small-trivial-type
  - signal-with-return-value
  - qproperty-type-mismatch, contributed by Jean-Michaël Celerier

Notes:
 * Removed level3. Moved all level3 checks to manual level. Doesn't make sense to enable all of them.
  Each one must be carefully considered.
 * Minimum LLVM was bumped to 5.0
 * Clazy no longer rewrites files directly, to avoid races when parallel invocations change the same header.
 * Clazy now exports a yaml file with the replacements, to be applied with clang-apply-replacements. 
The same way other clang tooling does it.
 * The way to enable code rewrite is now: -Xclang -plugin-arg-clazy -Xclang export-fixes for clang
or -export-fixes=somefile.yaml for clazy-standalone
 * All other fixit arguments and fixit env variables were removed
 * Thanks to Christian Gagneraud for contributing the fixit yaml exporter!

Bugfixes:
 * Fixed regressions with LLVM 9.0
 * Fixit infrastructure was overhauled

Version 1.5
~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2019-01-31

Features:
 * New Checks:
  - ifndef-define-typo
  - lowercase-qml-type-name
  - qrequiredresult-candidates
 * New Fixits:
  - range-loop now supports adding missing refs or const-ref
  - range-loop now supports adding qAsConst()
  - function-args-by-ref now adding missing refs or const-ref (experimental)
  - Introduced CLAZY_FIXIT_SUFFIX env variable

Notes:
 * Removed support for the obscure -DCLAZY_BUILD_UTILS_LIB to simplify the CMakeLists.txt
 * Renamed the clazy plugin from ClangLazy.so to ClazyPlugin.so
  - fully-qualified-moc-types now warns for slot/invokable return values too.
    They need to be fully qualified for QML.

Bugfixes:
 * Fixed a crash (clang assert) in raw-environment-function

Version 1.4
~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2018-09-23

Features:
 * New Checks:
  - connect-by-name
  - skipped-base-method
  - qstring-varargs
  - fully-qualified-moc-types
  - qt-keywords, with fixit included
  - qhash-with-char-pointer-key
  - wrong-qevent-cast
  - static-pmf
  - raw-environment-function
  - empty-qstringliteral
 * auto-unexpected-qstringbuilder now also warns for lambdas returning QStringBuilder

Notes:
 * performance optimizations
 * Added -header-filter=<regex> option to clazy-standalone. Only headers matching the regexp will
 have warnings, besides the .cpp file from the translation unit, which is never filtered out.
 * Added -ignore-dirs=<regex> option to clazy-standalone, and its CLAZY_IGNORE_DIRS env variable equivalent.
 * Added CLAZY_HEADER_FILTER env variable which adds above functionality to both clazy and clazy-standalone
 * unused-non-trivial-variable got unused-non-trivial-variable-no-whitelist option
 * unused-non-trivial-variable got user-blacklist and user-whitelist support
 * container-inside-loop is now a manual check instead of level2
 * HiddenLevel was renamed to ManualLevel
 * connect-3arg-lambda now warns when passing a lambda to QTimer::singleShot() or QMenu::addAction()
without a context object
 * old-style-connect warns for QMenu::addAction() and QMessageBox::open() too now

Version 1.3
~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2017-11-26

Features:
 * New checks:
  - thread-with-slots
  - connect-3arg-lambda
  - qproperty-without-notify
  - virtual-signal
  - overridden-signal
  - qhash-namespace
  - const-signal-or-slot
  - lambda-unique-connection

Notes:
 * missing-qobject-macro is now a level2 check, instead of level1. Because, people can omit Q_OBJECT intentionally.
 * Added -only-qt option, which will make clazy bailout early on non-Qt files.
   For this purpose, the definition of a Qt file is whenever -DQT_CORE_LIB is passed,
   which is usually the case in most build systems.
 * Added -qt-developer option, when building Qt with clazy it will honour specific guidelines for Qt,
   which are not many right now but the list will grow.

Version 1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2017-07-08

Features:
 * New checks:
  - install-event-filter
  - qcolor-from-literal
  - strict-iterators
  - connect-not-normalized

Bugfixes:
 * clazy-standalone executable. Allows to run clazy against a JSON compilation database
   instead of as a plugin. clang-tidy doesn't support loading external modules (https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/32086)
   so this is a good workaround.
 * qt-compat mode. Allows to disable Qt5 specific checks by passing -Xclang -plugin-arg-clazy -Xclang qt4-compat
  * returning-data-from-temporary now checks for temporary QByteArrays casting to char* when returned
  - returning-data-from-temporary now checks for assignment too, not only return statements
  * unused-non-trivial-variable now warns for unused QList, QVector and many more types
  * ASTMatchers based checks are now supported
  * clang 3.7 was dropped due to ASTMatchers source incompatibilities.
  * Use clazy v1.1 for clang >= 3.6 support
  * clazylib.so no longer gets built by default, only the plugin (ClangLazy.so)
    gets built. Pass -DCLAZY_BUILD_UTILS_LIB=ON to enable the utils library if
    you're developing tools using clazy's convenience functions, which you're
    probably not.
  * CLAZY_INSTALL_NO_HEADERS option was removed. Either install the utils library
    and headers or nothing at all. By default nothing is installed, except
    the plugin and man pages.
