* v0.0.1 (June 10th, 2015)
  - (...)


* v1.0 (September 12th, 2016)
  - (...)


* v1.1 (February 20th, 2017)

  - macOS and Windows support
  - New checks:
    child-event-qobject-cast
    ctor-missing-parent-argument
    returning-data-from-temporary
    qt-macros
    base-class-event
    connect-non-signal
    incorrect-emit
    tr-non-literal
  - Fixes against clang 4.0
  - Fixes against Qt 5.9
  - 60% performance improvement
  - Fixed many false positives


* v1.2 (July 8th, 2017)
  - clazy-standalone executable. Allows to run clazy against a JSON compilation database
    instead of as a plugin. clang-tidy doesn't support loading external modules (https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32739)
    so this is a good workaround.
  - qt-compat mode. Allows to disable Qt5 specific checks by passing -Xclang -plugin-arg-clazy -Xclang qt4-compat
  - New checks:
    install-event-filter
    qcolor-from-literal
    strict-iterators
    connect-not-normalized
  - returning-data-from-temporary now checks for temporary QByteArrays casting to char* when returned
  - returning-data-from-temporary now checks for assignment too, not only return statements
  - unused-non-trivial-variable now warns for unused QList, QVector and many more types
  - ASTMatchers based checks are now supported
  - clang 3.7 was dropped due to ASTMatchers source incompatibilities.
    Use clazy v1.1 for clang >= 3.6 support
  - clazylib.so no longer gets built by default, only the plugin (ClangLazy.so)
    gets built. Pass -DCLAZY_BUILD_UTILS_LIB=ON to enable the utils library if
    you're developing tools using clazy's convenience functions, which you're
    probably not.
  - CLAZY_INSTALL_NO_HEADERS option was removed. Either install the utils library
    and headers or nothing at all. By default nothing is installed, except
    the plugin and man pages.

* v1.3 (November 26th, 2017)
  - New checks:
    thread-with-slots
    connect-3arg-lambda
    qproperty-without-notify
    virtual-signal
    overridden-signal
    qhash-namespace
    const-signal-or-slot
    lambda-unique-connection
  - missing-qobject-macro is now a level2 check, instead of level1. Because,
    people can omit Q_OBJECT intentionally.
  - Added -only-qt option, which will make clazy bailout early on non-Qt files.
    For this purpose, the definition of a Qt file is whenever -DQT_CORE_LIB is passed, which is usually the case in most build systems.
  - Added -qt-developer option, when building Qt with clazy it will honour specific guidelines for Qt, which are not many right now but the
    list will grow.

* v1.4 (September 23rd, 2018)
  - New Checks:
    connect-by-name
    skipped-base-method
    qstring-varargs
    fully-qualified-moc-types
    qt-keywords, with fixit included
    qhash-with-char-pointer-key
    wrong-qevent-cast
    static-pmf
    raw-environment-function
    empty-qstringliteral
  - auto-unexpected-qstringbuilder now also warns for lambdas returning QStringBuilder
  - performance optimizations
  - Added -header-filter=<regex> option to clazy-standalone. Only headers matching the regexp will have warnings,
    besides the .cpp file from the translation unit, which is never filtered out.
  - Added -ignore-dirs=<regex> option to clazy-standalone, and its CLAZY_IGNORE_DIRS env variable equivalent.
  - Added CLAZY_HEADER_FILTER env variable which adds above functionality to both clazy and clazy-standalone
  - unused-non-trivial-variable got unused-non-trivial-variable-no-whitelist option
  - unused-non-trivial-variable got user-blacklist and user-whitelist support
  - container-inside-loop is now a manual check instead of level2
  - HiddenLevel was renamed to ManualLevel
  - connect-3arg-lambda now warns when passing a lambda to QTimer::singleShot() or QMenu::addAction() without a context object
  - old-style-connect warns for QMenu::addAction() and QMessageBox::open() too now

* v1.5 (January 31st, 2019)
  - New Checks:
    ifndef-define-typo
    lowercase-qml-type-name
    qrequiredresult-candidates
  - New Fixits:
    range-loop now supports adding missing refs or const-ref
    range-loop now supports adding qAsConst()
    function-args-by-ref now adding missing refs or const-ref (experimental)
    Introduced CLAZY_FIXIT_SUFFIX env variable
  - Removed support for the obscure -DCLAZY_BUILD_UTILS_LIB to simplify the CMakeLists.txt
  - Renamed the clazy plugin from ClangLazy.so to ClazyPlugin.so
  - fully-qualified-moc-types now warns for slot/invokable return values too. They need to be fully qualified for QML.
  - Fixed a crash (clang assert) in raw-environment-function


* v1.6 (October 12, 2019)
  - New Checks:
    - heap-allocated-small-trivial-type
    - signal-with-return-value
    - qproperty-type-mismatch, contributed by Jean-Michaël Celerier
  - Removed level3. Moved all level3 checks to manual level. Doesn't make sense to enable all of them. Each one must be carefully considered.
  - Fixed regressions with LLVM 9.0
  - Minimum LLVM was bumped to 5.0
  - Fixit infrastructure was overhauled
    Clazy no longer rewrites files directly, to avoid races when parallel invocations change the same header.
    Clazy now exports a yaml file with the replacements, to be applied with clang-apply-replacements. The same way other clang tooling does it.
    The way to enable code rewrite is now: -Xclang -plugin-arg-clazy -Xclang export-fixes for clang or -export-fixes=somefile.yaml for clazy-standalone
    All other fixit arguments and fixit env variables were removed
    Thanks to Christian Gagneraud for contributing the fixit yaml exporter!

* v1.7 (June 29th, 2020)
  - New Checks:
    - overloaded signal
    - invalid JNI signatures
    - qstring-comparison-to-implicit-char
    - qt6-qlatin1string-to-u
  - connect-non-signal: Fix case where it didn't find the pmf
  - qstring-arg warns when using QLatin1String::arg(int), as it casts to QChar
  - Building clazy itself is 30% faster
  - heap-allocated-small-trivial-type: less false-positives

* v1.8 (2020)
    - New Checks:
      - qt6-qhash-signature
      - qt6-qdir-fixes
      - qt6-header-fixes
      - use-chrono-in-qtimer
      - fixit for missing-qobject-macro
